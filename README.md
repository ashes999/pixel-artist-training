### So You Want to be a Pixel Artist
Being a pixel artist is a challenge. It takes dedication, skill, and above all, persistence and practice. Instead of struggling through random tutorials, I decided to put together a rigorous gauntlet, a veritable curriculum, an interactive workshop, that takes you through the stages from your first pixel art to mastering the finer points of pixelry.

Aside from reading material, this workshop takes you through assignments to test your mettle and force you to apply what you learn.

### How to Use this Workshop
Ultimately, only you can judge whether you have learned something enough to progress to the next stage, or whether you need to keep practicing. Stay focused, and don't give up until it's "good enough" for you.

Start at the top, and work through the tutorials in order. If you have some experience, skim until you find a comfortable place to dive into.

Also, I suggest opening an account somewhere like [deviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com) where you can post your work. It provides you with a good, historical record of your progression (and occasional feedback from others).

Ready? Let's begin.

### Tutorials
#### Tools Setup
You need an accessible image manipulation tool for pixel art. GIMP is the way to go (it's free and more than adequate for the task). 

**Readings:**
- Sections 1-3 of [Basics for Beginners](http://gasara.deviantart.com/art/Pixel-Art-Tutorial-Basics-for-Beginners-356743783)

**Workshop:**
- Download and install [GIMP] (http://www.gimp.org/downloads/).

#### Line Art
Pixel Art works with a specific style of lines. You need to master lines in order to create art that doesn't look jagged or "wrong."

**Readings:**
- Chapter 2 of [The Complete Guide to Isometric Pixel Art](http://www.xena.ww7.be/neofutur/tools/pixelart/).
- Chapter 2: [Lines and Curves](http://opengameart.org/content/chapter-2-lines-and-curves).

**Workshop:**
- Create all of the basic shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, and pyramid) from the first reading.
- Create a piece like the Combining Shapes tutorial, which is a composite of multiple basic shapes.
- Create a piece using curvy lines using the Les Forages transition method (`5 4 3 2 2 1 1 1 2 3` ...)
- Create at least three pieces of pure line-art for three objects (eg. sword, dragon, toaster).

#### Perspective
**Readings:**
- http://opengameart.org/content/chapter-3-perspectives

**Workshop:**
- Make a 45-degree piece
- Make something with a round top (circle, not ellipse)

#### Lighting and Shadows
**Readings:**
- http://opengameart.org/content/chapter-4-shadow-and-light (shade whole areas that are in dark)
- http://finalbossblues.com/using-and-choosing-colors/ (ramps)
- http://finalbossblues.com/form-and-light/

**Workshop:**
- Create something with an irregular shape (eg. slime, treasure chest) and shade it. 
- Re-shade the above piece, from a different angle.
- Create something using four shades of grey. It should look good. (Save it for the Colour section.)

#### Colour
**Readings:**
- http://opengameart.org/content/chapter-5-color-palettes

**Workshop:**
- Colour your grey-scale image from the Lighting and Shadows section. Use the rule of "darker colours are more saturated."
- Recolour your image, using the rule of "lighter colours are more saturated."

#### Advanced/Misc
- http://finalbossblues.com/tiling-tiles/ (create a grass tile; sand tile)
- http://opengameart.org/content/chapter-4-shadow-and-light (create reflected light, like the final image)
- http://ashiqalibhai.deviantart.com/art/Spriting-Fakemon-Tutorial-V-3-280927794 (create a fakemon)
- http://opengameart.org/content/chapter-5-color-palettes (create a gem, and use white for highlighting. Create something metal, and again use white for highlighting.)
- http://gas13.ru/v3/tutorials/sywtbapa_world_of_sprites.php (create a 32x32 character)

### Where to get Feedback
