<p>Being a pixel artist is a challenge. It takes dedication, skill, and above all, persistence and practice. Instead of struggling through random tutorials, I decided to put together a rigorous gauntlet, a veritable curriculum, an interactive workshop, that takes you through the stages from your first pixel art to mastering the finer points of pixelry.</p>

<p>Aside from reading material, this workshop takes you through assignments to test your mettle and force you to apply what you learn.</p>

<p>Ultimately, only you can judge whether you have learned something enough to progress to the next stage, or whether you need to keep practicing. Stay focused, and don't give up until it's "good enough" for you.</p>

<p>Start at the top, and work through the tutorials in order. If you have some experience, skim until you find a comfortable place to dive into.</p>

<p>Ready? Let's begin.</p>
