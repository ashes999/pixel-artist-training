{"name":"Pixel Artist Training","tagline":"An interactive workshop designed to turn you into a proficient pixel artist.","body":"### So You Want to be a Pixel Artist\r\nBeing a pixel artist is a challenge. It takes dedication, skill, and above all, persistence and practice. Instead of struggling through random tutorials, I decided to put together a rigorous gauntlet, a veritable curriculum, an interactive workshop, that takes you through the stages from your first pixel art to mastering the finer points of pixelry.\r\n\r\nAside from reading material, this workshop takes you through assignments to test your mettle and force you to apply what you learn.\r\n\r\n### How to Use this Workshop\r\nUltimately, only you can judge whether you have learned something enough to progress to the next stage, or whether you need to keep practicing. Stay focused, and don't give up until it's \"good enough\" for you.\r\n\r\nStart at the top, and work through the tutorials in order. If you have some experience, skim until you find a comfortable place to dive into.\r\n\r\nReady? Let's begin.\r\n\r\n### Tutorials\r\n#### [1] Tools Setup\r\nYou need an accessible image manipulation tool for pixel art. GIMP is the way to go (it's free and more than adequate for the task). \r\n\r\n**Readings:**\r\n- Sections 1-3 of [Basics for Beginners](http://gasara.deviantart.com/art/Pixel-Art-Tutorial-Basics-for-Beginners-356743783)\r\n\r\n**Workshop:**\r\n- Download and install [GIMP] (http://www.gimp.org/downloads/).\r\n\r\n### [2] Line Art\r\nPixel Art works with a specific style of lines. You need to master lines in order to create art that doesn't look jagged or \"wrong.\"\r\n\r\n**Readings:**\r\n- Chapter 2 of [The Complete Guide to Isometric Pixel Art](http://www.xena.ww7.be/neofutur/tools/pixelart/).\r\n- Chapter 2 of [Les Forages Pixel Art Tutorial](http://opengameart.org/content/chapter-2-lines-and-curves).\r\n\r\n**Workshop:**\r\n- Create all of the basic shapes (cube, sphere, cylinder, and pyramid) from the first reading.\r\n- Create a piece like the Combining Shapes tutorial, which is a composite of multiple basic shapes.\r\n- Create a piece using curvy lines using the Les Forages transition method (`5 4 3 2 2 1 1 1 2 3` ...)\r\n- Create at least three pieces of pure line-art for three objects (eg. sword, dragon, toaster).\r\n\r\n### References\r\n- [Pixel Art Tutorial: Basics for Beginners, by Gasara (deviantArt)](http://gasara.deviantart.com/art/Pixel-Art-Tutorial-Basics-for-Beginners-356743783)\r\n- [The Complete Guide to to Isometric Pixel Art](http://www.xena.ww7.be/neofutur/tools/pixelart/)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
